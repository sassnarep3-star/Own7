### Integration conflict resolution (this merge)
- `index.html` add/add conflict: root `index.html` from main (session 5051651b research lab) kept in full; this session's landing moved to `pages/dashboard.html`; all my pages' Dashboard nav links point to `pages/dashboard.html`. No other session's work discarded.
- `COORDINATION.md` add/add conflict: both session boards retained in this unified document.
- No values inferred or filled in; blanks remain where no official source confirms (market lines, correlation coefficients — see pages/flagged.html).

### Rules for all sessions
- Claim a task by writing your session ID and file scope, commit + push immediately; never start a task another session has claimed.
- Keep scopes non-overlapping; session branches or worktrees named session-<id>/<task>.
- Small, frequent commits; `git pull --rebase` before every push.
- On conflict: stop, resolve without discarding the other session's work, log what happened.
- Never infer or fill in values; leave blank + flag as unverified if no official source confirms. Link the source.

## Session e09e45e6 — independent audit and final integration (2026-11-03)

Fixed Arena branch: `arena/e09e45e6-own7` (platform constraint takes precedence over requested branch naming). Earlier completed boards are historical; no other active claim observed.

| Task | Status | Owner | Files touched | Verification / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Independent source audit, quarantine unsupported values, integrate dashboard, test and publish | in progress | session-e09e45e6 | COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html, pages/*, data/*, docs/*, scripts/*, verified/*, .github/workflows/* | Rechecking prior verified claims; no inherited verification assumed. |

### e09e45e6 audit findings and verification
- Initial remote branch did not exist, so `git pull --rebase origin arena/e09e45e6-own7` failed without modifying files; rebased against `origin main` before first branch push. No conflicts or other session work discarded; historical versions remain in Git history.
- Canonical root dashboard now supersedes three conflicting views; old HTML URLs remain as explicit superseded notices. Scope is source-linked research, not an operating betting system.
- Read official NBA standings in both fetch chunks and compared all 30 CSV rows (rank, identity, W/L, WIN%, GB, conference/division/home/road/last10/streak). Source: https://www.nba.com/standings . Snapshot only, 2026-11-03.
- Read NBA player traditional season/filter content: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional ; no historical player values confirmed. Blanked unconfirmed numerical team/player CSV fields; retained row identities as unverified.
- Read NBA glossary USG% definition: https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary ; calibration scoring/reliability: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html ; time-order leakage: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html ; Pearson API: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html . Linked sources distinguish facts, methods and project proposals.
- Inherited Alberta rules/helplines and media-reported restrictions not independently endorsed; legacy JSON verified flags downgraded and value columns blanked. Historical narratives explicitly superseded. Findings F01–F09 published on review.html (needs review; nonblocking).
- Inventory with line counts and hashes: docs/audit-manifest.json. This is not a claim that every historical sentence was scientifically verified.
- Tests: deterministic dashboard generation; recursive local HTML link and per-table HTTPS source check; 5 synthetic math tests passed (fair odds, push settlement, no-vig, Pearson, invalid inputs). No synthetic result is presented as NBA evidence. No future predictive skill claimed.
- Task status: research/integration done; scientific evidence gaps needs review; publication in progress.

### Publication complete — session e09e45e6
- Task status: done. Nonblocking evidence gaps: needs review, published at https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own7/review.html .
- PR https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own7/pull/7 merged successfully at 2026-11-03T23:38:29Z; merge commit `c234aad6f07df47927b6109dd09edf845087b323`. All PR checks passed before merge.
- GitHub Pages deployment https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own7/actions/runs/41740756061 completed successfully (build, deploy and report all green).
- Live content independently fetched at https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own7/?audit=676d1e4 and confirmed the new eight-candidate audited executive summary. The bare URL initially returned cached old content; cache-busted fetch confirmed publication.
- No actual betting edge, estimated coefficient, profitable strategy, cash prize or live model has been invented. Remaining scientific work cannot be certified without verified game-level and market data.
