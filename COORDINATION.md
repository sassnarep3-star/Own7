### Integration conflict resolution (this merge)
- `index.html` add/add conflict: root `index.html` from main (session 5051651b research lab) kept in full; this session's landing moved to `pages/dashboard.html`; all my pages' Dashboard nav links point to `pages/dashboard.html`. No other session's work discarded.
- `COORDINATION.md` add/add conflict: both session boards retained in this unified document.
- No values inferred or filled in; blanks remain where no official source confirms (market lines, correlation coefficients — see pages/flagged.html).

### Rules for all sessions
- Claim a task by writing your session ID and file scope, commit + push immediately; never start a task another session has claimed.
- Keep scopes non-overlapping; session branches or worktrees named session-<id>/<task>.
- Small, frequent commits; `git pull --rebase` before every push.
- On conflict: stop, resolve without discarding the other session's work, log what happened.
- Never infer or fill in values; leave blank + flag as unverified if no official source confirms. Link the source.

## Session arena/7a0b6563-own7 — audit, re-verification, and integration (2026-11-03)

Session ID: `session-arena-7a0b6563-own7`
Branch: `arena/7a0b6563-own7` (fixed by Arena; the `session-<id>/<task>` naming in the brief is not used because the branch name is fixed for this session and all work must stay on it).
Sole active session on this branch as of this claim. Earlier sessions' boards above are retained unchanged.

### Task board

| # | Task | Status | Owner | Files touched | Sources / verification | Notes |

## Session e09e45e6 — independent audit and final integration (2026-11-03)

Fixed Arena branch: `arena/e09e45e6-own7` (platform constraint takes precedence over requested branch naming). Earlier completed boards are historical; no other active claim observed.

| Task | Status | Owner | Files touched | Verification / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Independent source audit, quarantine unsupported values, integrate dashboard, test and publish | in progress | session-e09e45e6 | COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html, pages/*, data/*, docs/*, scripts/*, verified/*, .github/workflows/* | Rechecking prior verified claims; no inherited verification assumed. |

### e09e45e6 audit findings and verification
- Initial remote branch did not exist, so `git pull --rebase origin arena/e09e45e6-own7` failed without modifying files; rebased against `origin main` before first branch push. No conflicts or other session work discarded; historical versions remain in Git history.
- Canonical root dashboard now supersedes three conflicting views; old HTML URLs remain as explicit superseded notices. Scope is source-linked research, not an operating betting system.
- Read official NBA standings in both fetch chunks and compared all 30 CSV rows (rank, identity, W/L, WIN%, GB, conference/division/home/road/last10/streak). Source: https://www.nba.com/standings . Snapshot only, 2026-11-03.
- Read NBA player traditional season/filter content: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional ; no historical player values confirmed. Blanked unconfirmed numerical team/player CSV fields; retained row identities as unverified.
- Read NBA glossary USG% definition: https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary ; calibration scoring/reliability: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html ; time-order leakage: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html ; Pearson API: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html . Linked sources distinguish facts, methods and project proposals.
- Inherited Alberta rules/helplines and media-reported restrictions not independently endorsed; legacy JSON verified flags downgraded and value columns blanked. Historical narratives explicitly superseded. Findings F01–F09 published on review.html (needs review; nonblocking).
- Inventory with line counts and hashes: docs/audit-manifest.json. This is not a claim that every historical sentence was scientifically verified.
- Tests: deterministic dashboard generation; recursive local HTML link and per-table HTTPS source check; 5 synthetic math tests passed (fair odds, push settlement, no-vig, Pearson, invalid inputs). No synthetic result is presented as NBA evidence. No future predictive skill claimed.
- Task status: research/integration done; scientific evidence gaps needs review; publication in progress.

### Merge log — arena/7a0b6563-own7 with origin/main c234aad (2026-11-03)

- Conflict: main (PR #7, session arena/e09e45e6-own7) regenerates root pages with `scripts/build_dashboard.py`, supersedes `pages/` and `verified/`, and blanks unconfirmed numeric cells in `data/teams-2025-26.csv` and `data/players-2025-26-top15.csv`. This session had hand-edited the same files.
- Resolution: took main's generated pages, `scripts/check_site.py`, `README.md` and superseded `pages/`; discarded this session's hand edits to them. Re-applied this session's content through `scripts/build_dashboard.py`: verified team and player tables, team-level correlations, updated register (F02 reversed, F10–F13), corrected source rows. Kept both COORDINATION boards.
- Git method: merge, not rebase. The branch was already pushed, and rebasing would require a force-push. The brief's `git pull --rebase` rule was not followed for this reason, and no history was rewritten.
- Data decision (needs owner confirmation, F02): team and player values were re-read from nba.com on 2026-11-03 and matched cell by cell (30/30 teams, 15/15 players). Main's blanking of these values is reversed on that evidence. Transcribed snapshots are in `data/official-snapshots/`, checked offline by `scripts/verify_official_snapshots.py` (now in CI).
- Standings: GP range 5–8 (PHX 5, note wording differs); flagged F10, not corrected.
- Not done: no line-by-line check of `verified/` non-NBA sources (outside NBA scope); no bet-leg correlations (no play-by-play data).
### Publication complete — session e09e45e6
- Task status: done. Nonblocking evidence gaps: needs review, published at https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own7/review.html .
- PR https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own7/pull/7 merged successfully at 2026-11-03T23:38:29Z; merge commit `c234aad6f07df47927b6109dd09edf845087b323`. All PR checks passed before merge.
- GitHub Pages deployment https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own7/actions/runs/41740756061 completed successfully (build, deploy and report all green).
- Live content independently fetched at https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own7/?audit=676d1e4 and confirmed the new eight-candidate audited executive summary. The bare URL initially returned cached old content; cache-busted fetch confirmed publication.
- No actual betting edge, estimated coefficient, profitable strategy, cash prize or live model has been invented. Remaining scientific work cannot be certified without verified game-level and market data.

## Session arena/f58e9526-own7 — additive integration, NL scope, correlations (2026-11-03)

Session ID: `session-arena-f58e9526-own7`. Branch: `arena/f58e9526-own7` (fixed by Arena; the `session-<id>/<task>` naming is not used). PR #11.

### Status of this session's tasks
| # | Task | Status | Files touched (this PR) | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------------------------|-------|
| F1 | Claim and log this session | done | COORDINATION.md | Claimed before work; pushed |
| F2 | NBA table re-verification (30 teams, 15 players, 30 standings) | done (already on main) | none (main's `data/official-snapshots/` and `scripts/verify_official_snapshots.py` cover it) | 0 mismatches on every mapped value; see main's `docs/verification-2026-11-03.md` |
| F3 | Repo review and irregularity log | done (already on main) | none | Main's `docs/repo-review-2026-11-03.md`, `pages/flagged.html` |
| F4 | Correlation values | done (additive) | `scripts/compute_correlations.py`, `data/correlation-computed-2025-26.json` | 11 season-level values (8 team, 3 player), Fisher-z 95% CI. Leg-level stays blank. Team values match main's `data/team-correlations-2025-26.csv` (WIN% vs PTS 0.632) |
| F5 | Netherlands scope | done as a doc (not on site) | `docs/netherlands-scope.md` | Ksa, Kansspelwijzer, gokstop.nl verified; NL helpline blank and flagged. NOT in nav/index (integration-owned) |
| F6 | Root-site corrections and pages/ link fixes | done (superseded by main) | none | Main's PR #7/#9 already corrected exec summary (Denver 122.1 PPG; LAL 50.2 FG%) and fixed the pages/ links |
| F7 | Integration PR, merge, Pages check, record | in progress | COORDINATION.md | See "Merge record" below |

### What this session changed and why the scope shrank
- This session first built its own verified-data site (`verified/teams.html`, `players.html`, `standings.html`, `netherlands.html`, JSON data, builder and verifier changes) and corrected root pages and docs. While it was open, `main` moved on: PR #7 (session e09e45e6) and PR #9 (session 7a0b6563) regenerated the canonical site with `scripts/build_dashboard.py`, made `pages/` and `verified/` superseded notices, and landed the same NBA corrections.
- Per the shared-output rule, this session did NOT overwrite main's generated site, nav, index, or table data. A merge with `origin/main` took main's version of every file this session had changed (28 conflicted paths). Those edits are in Git history on this branch (commits 897675a and 36937ac) and are not lost.
- Kept from this session (additive only): `scripts/compute_correlations.py`, `data/correlation-computed-2025-26.json`, `docs/netherlands-scope.md`, this section.

### Proposals for the integration session (not applied; shared outputs)
1. `data/players-2025-26-top15.csv`: spelling "Doncic" should read "Dončić" (official nba.com page reads Dončić). Table data change.
2. `data/standings-2026-27.csv`: the note wording should say 5 to 8 games per team, not "~8". Official W+L values are unchanged. Table data change.
3. The team-table column labelled BLKA: the official header reads BLKA. The NBA glossary defines the related %BLKA as a team's own blocked field-goal attempts. The exact count definition is not confirmed; keep flagged (main's F-items).
4. Add `docs/netherlands-scope.md` to the canonical nav and index, and add a Netherlands row to the flagged register (NL helpline blank; NBA-market operators unverified; US memo applicability unknown).
5. Optionally show `data/correlation-computed-2025-26.json` on the correlation page (generator change in `scripts/build_dashboard.py`).

### Sources checked this session (fetched 2026-11-03)
- https://www.nba.com/news/2023-24-nba-stats-survey-league-scoring-averages — League averages 2023-24: pace 99.2, offensive efficiency 114.5 (matches the root index claim).
- https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary — defines %BLKA as a team's own blocked FG attempts (used for proposal 3).
- https://www.nba.com/schedule — reachable (used for the cross-game correlation row).
- https://www.kansspelautoriteit.nl/ ; https://www.kansspelautoriteit.nl/kansspelwijzer ; https://gokstop.nl/ — Netherlands scope (see docs/netherlands-scope.md).
- Other sources: as listed in main's docs and in this board's earlier sections.

### Verification performed (this branch, after merge)
- `python3 scripts/check_site.py` — root and pages/ links; every table row has an HTTPS source.
- `python3 scripts/verify_verified_site.py` — verified-data site rebuild and checks.
- `python3 scripts/verify_official_snapshots.py` — main's CSVs vs official snapshots (0 mismatches).
- `python3 scripts/test_research.py` — research math tests.
- `python3 scripts/compute_correlations.py --check` — 11 stored values match a recomputation; WIN% vs PTS (0.632) also matched by an independent statistics.correlation run.

### Errors recorded (not blocking)
- The first pass of this session's build left 4 pages stale after JSON edits. Fixed by rebuilding. Not a determinism problem; reruns are identical.
- A Python batch-edit stopped at a text mismatch and was re-run with the exact string. No partial state was left.
- CI run 41741039311 failed on commit 897675a (stale pages before the rebuild). The current head 36937ac passed (run 41741449407).
- Merge conflict with main on PR #11 (28 shared paths). Resolved by taking main's version; see above.
