# OWN7 · NBA Research Lab

[Live dashboard](https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own7/) · [Executive brief](docs/executive-summary.md) · [Sources](research/sources.json) · [Coordination / release evidence](COORDINATION.md)

One static, source-linked dashboard replaces the repository’s three inconsistent earlier sites. It contains **107 checked official snapshot rows**, eight strategy hypotheses, six exploratory correlation estimates, 88 retrospective probability demonstrations, ten fail-closed validation gates, an empty qualified leaderboard, a requirements ledger and a complete baseline file audit.

**No verified betting edge, executable NBA line, ROI, CLV, cash prize or winning strategy is claimed.** Blank values are intentional. Luck cannot be removed.

## Important source restriction

[NBA terms §9(iv)](https://www.nba.com/termsofuse) expressly prohibit using NBA Statistics in connection with gambling activity, including legal gambling. Separate authorization is not evidenced. NBA-derived betting-price release, bulk data harvesting, wagering and cash payments are disabled. This is a frozen, attributed statistical audit and non-commercial methods demonstration, not a licensed gambling data product or legal advice.

## Reproduce without manual data entry

Python 3.11+; the research and static build use the standard library only:

```sh
python -m nba_lab run
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/build_site.py
python scripts/check_site.py
```

Optional full browser/accessibility verification (Linux x64; Node 22.17+):

```sh
npm ci
npm run test:browser
```

The browser binary ships in an npm development package; no runtime dependency, CDN or browser download is needed. To view locally:

```sh
python scripts/serve_site.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Evidence and limits

- `data/*.csv`: 30 team rows, 15 scoring-filtered players, 30 standings rows and a complete explicit 32-game Jokić window. Every row has an official source URL. Snapshots checked 2026-11-03, not live feeds.
- `research/evidence/`: exact scopes, normalized transcriptions, row checks and integrity receipts. **Not raw HTTP archives or independent second sources.** Later hash/equality checks establish integrity, not factual truth.
- `research/sources.json`: primary-source publisher, URL, check date and actual checked scope. NBA values are observed; model outputs are explicitly derived; policies/thresholds are project designs.
- `research/results.json`: deterministic correlation/interval/joint-rate calculations, chronological probability ledger, null prices/ROI/CLV, blocked gates, input/code hashes and run hash.
- `research/catalog.json`, `research/protocol.json`: hypotheses, all ten gates, review items, method choices and non-monetary competition rules.
- `research/audit/`: 54-file / 2,630-line baseline inventory and dispositions; tests and release evidence. Original historical assertions remain inspectable in git, not as active verified facts.
- `research/requirements.json`: every requirement mapped to an artifact and honest status; blocked research/rights requirements are not marked complete.

The cohort, player, thresholds and window were selected retrospectively. Paired five-game block intervals are exploratory, not selection-adjusted confidence in an edge. No source quote archive, licensed odds feed, pregame information archive or untouched prospective test exists. A scoring-selected top-15 table is not a complete player universe. Details are on **Flagged for Review**.

## Website and deployment

`scripts/build_site.py` generates all canonical root pages and redirects old `pages/` and `verified/` HTML URLs to the matching current category. The old JSON schemas are explicit deprecation pointers, not duplicate sources of truth. The original script names remain compatibility entrypoints.

GitHub Pages publishes the root of `main`. CI checks source/blank contracts, receipts, math, chronology, recursive links/fragments, byte-identical rebuilds, keyboard interactions, CSV export, desktop/mobile rendering and accessibility. Scheduled source-health checks save non-mutating audit artifacts; they never collect NBA feeds or promote a source URL to factual verification. Claims/deployment evidence are recorded in `COORDINATION.md`.

No repository license was inferred or granted. Third-party source terms remain applicable. Non-monetary merit points have no cash/transferable value; no eligible strategy currently earns any.
